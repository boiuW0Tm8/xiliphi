          <p>
            Xiliphi is a skincare brand built around the idea that effective
            skincare doesn’t need to be complicated. We focus on clean,
            minimal formulations made with natural, vegan ingredients — each
            chosen for a clear purpose, not marketing noise.
          </p>

          <p>
            The name <strong>Xiliphi</strong> reflects this philosophy.{" "}
            <strong>Xi (洗)</strong> means <em>to cleanse</em>, while{" "}
            <strong>Li (力)</strong> represents <em>strength</em>. Together,
            they represent the idea of strength through cleanliness — skincare
            that supports the skin’s natural function rather than overwhelming it.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Phi (φ)</strong> refers to the golden ratio, a principle found
            throughout nature and often associated with balance and efficiency.
            At Xiliphi, it symbolizes our approach to formulation: using the
            right balance of ingredients, at the right concentrations, to achieve
            results without excess.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every Xiliphi product is designed with balance in mind — between
            effectiveness and simplicity, quality and accessibility, performance
            and sustainability. We carefully consider ingredient sourcing,
            formulation efficiency, and packaging choices to minimize waste
            while keeping products effective and reasonably priced.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal is not to chase trends, but to create skincare that feels
            intentional, honest, and reliable — products you can understand,
            trust, and use every day.
